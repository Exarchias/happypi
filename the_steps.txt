The step 2 details for a hadshake
=================================
http://194.47.34.210:3000/onoff
sudo node examples/ifttt_gas.js -e onoff -k LcQX9ZGb 
//at the moment gives an error noble: unknow peripheral e00f05209a39 handle notify!
//it seems that error comes from a disconnection.

a repository to try to clone, (a nodejs project that I wish to check if it works)
=================================================================================
sudo git clone https://github.com/NordicPlayground/webapp-nordic-thingy.git

EXPLAINATIONS
=============

webapp-nordic-thingy
====================
It tries to use react instance. Right click on ht eReact folder and select "visual studio code".
1)sudo npm install //danger to froze the pi
2)sudo npm start
This instance serves as a proof that React can't work on the node.js version we are using.


expressThingy52Nhs100
=====================
It serves as an example. it just includes both thingy52 and hs100 in the same express instance.
By itself it does nothing. but the examples server to understand both technologies.
The hs100 ip is configured correctly: 192.168.1.201
1)sudo npm install
Maybe "sudo npm install tplink-smarthome-api" as well. 
2)sudo npm start


expressNhs100
=============
An express instance of the proxy server that turns on and off the smart plug HS100 through its ip (192.168.1.201) and it is accessed by get on "http://localhost:3000/onoff"
Is made to work on Windows. To make it work on pi, the module 'tplink-smarthome-api' is needed to installed explicitelly, but it seems to work with a simple inclusive install.
Important to run it with sudo:
1)sudo npm install
Maybe "sudo npm install tplink-smarthome-api" as well. 
2)sudo npm start
